**Keep your rent.**

Or, at least, consider it.

If you're living in Long Beach, chances are your rent is, at minimum, somewhere in the range of $600 - $800. That's with a roommate, and if you're lucky. Most of us are shelling out somewhere closer to \$1000, every month, just for shelter. A place to live.

We have car payments for our cars, payments for debt and loans, and, on top of all that there's rent: the one big slap-in-the-face payment you make every month.

In the midst of a global pandemic, we think there are several reasons you might want to consider keeping your rent:

- You lost work, may lose work, or can't work, and money for rent is better spent on food
- You lost work, may lose work, or can't work, and you _can't_ pay rent
- You are standing in solidarity with those who can't pay rent, for one of the above or any variety of other reasons

We could get new jobs, of course, but for those of us particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, the risk of the virus stands as another deterrent (besides the nature of work itself) to rejoining the workforce, and for those of us not vulnerable, well, maybe we just don't like working. Or rent.

Threats of evictions and landlord retaliation and the risk therein make the idea of not paying rent a dauting one. Here are some resources to help you get away with it:

### RULE #1: THE MORE OF US, THE BETTER

They can't evict all of us.

The best advice of any of these resources is that we are stronger together, and more of us acting together means more chance of us winning and coming away from the pandemic with more dignity, more cash, and networks of care that sustain us through future crises.

## More Resources

> We do not know how long we will be out of work and confined to our homes. We do not trust the federal or state governments to provide the resources we need to survive. We recommend saving your rent money for basic necessities, food and medications. We need whatever money we have. We can’t eat the rent.

> Unstable housing is exacerbating this crisis. If tenants know that missing rent could result in eviction proceedings, they’ll be more likely to go to work with symptoms and risk getting others sick. Tenants forced to move face a higher risk of spreading and/or contracting the virus, along with difficulty securing new housing, renting moving trucks, hiring movers, or finding volunteers to help. It is our responsibility to protect each other. In the absence of compassionate leadership from our government, we must organize together to ensure our basic needs are met.
