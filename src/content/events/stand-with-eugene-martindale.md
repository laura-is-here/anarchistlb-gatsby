Last week, LBPD officers, one armed with a baton, beat a community member who was restrained and facedown in the street.

The person targeted was Eugene Martindale III, and, despite LBPD's insistence that they were faced with a violent individual attempting to steal vehicles in the area, Eugene's father has revealed that his son was undergoing a mental health crisis and was attempting to seek help from passerby.

## LBPD has a history of violence against individuals experiencing mental health crises

[Feras Morad](https://lbpost.com/news/city/jury-rules-officer-who-shot-cal-state-long-beach-student-didnt-use-excessive-force/) and [Sinuon Pream](https://lbpost.com/news/jury-awards-9-8-million-to-family-of-mentally-ill-woman-shot-by-long-beach-police) are two of many names that we remember who have faced violence at the hands of LBPD during mental health crises. For Feras and Sinuon, this violence was, unfortunately, fatal. From the Long Beach Post:

> The officers, believing Pream to be possibly transient and suffering from a mental illness, ordered her to drop the weapon—a fruit carving knife less than 4 inches long... Less than a minute later, the officers fired a total of eight total rounds at Pream, hitting her seven times...

Let the fact that Eugene Martindale III survived his encounter with LBPD give us some solace as we move ahead to fight back against the police, and as we fight to support Eugene.

## Court Support for Eugene Martindale III Thursday, Feb. 27th

Eugene's father has shared with us the details of his son's expected hearing date:

- February 27th
- 8:30am
- Long Beach Superior Court, 275 Magnolia Ave
- Department J

[Yesterday we marched](https://lbpost.com/news/anti-police-protest-cindy-allen), and on Thursday we are calling for all those committed to fighting back against the police to show up to Department J and stand with Eugene.

In Long Beach, the police are handed **48% of the city's general fund** by the city council and the mayor — and here's what we have to show for it: death, violence, and lies.

Fuck LBPD, and fuck the police.
