Earlier this week, LBPD officers, one armed with a baton, beat a community member who was restrained and facedown in the street.

[A user on Twitter shared a video of the assault (content warning for police violence)](https://twitter.com/PRP_LB/status/1229954805952466944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

This is a call to action against the LBPD, against all police violence, and against the existence of policing.

In Long Beach, the police are handed **48% of the city's general fund** by the city council and the mayor — and for what?

To "clean up" the streets by targeting and harassing the poor, unhoused, and people of color?

To protect developers with enough money to change the very face of our city while displacing long-term residents?

## LBPD sets their own rules and determines for themselves whether those rules were followed

The police are a white supremacist institution given free reign by city officials to make and enforce their own rules and standards of conduct.

[From a report on the incident by the Long Beach Post](https://lbpost.com/news/crime/video-baton-beating-resisting-carjack)

> According to the Long Beach police department’s policy, officers may use batons to defend themselves or to combat violently resisting suspects.
>
> The LBPD manual also says officers can use a baton to hit someone if officers believe the person has committed a crime and he or she won’t allow officers to handcuff or search them.

And

> Police said they’re now reviewing the use of force to make sure it was justified, as is typical with all such incidents.

Of course, we all know what they'll find.

Let's stand up for all those targeted and harassed by the police; let's stand against the LBPD's vice grip on our city. We will march and rally against the LBPD this Sunday, February 23rd. Rally to start 10:30am at Harvey Milk Park.

Fuck the LBPD, and fuck the police.
