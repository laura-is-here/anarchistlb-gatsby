Our first reading group discussion will be this Friday, October 4th, from 6 - 8pm at Page Against the Machine, 2714 E 4th St.

> Scratch a misogynist and youâ€™ll find a homophobe. Scratch a little deeper and you might find the makings of a future informant (or someone who just destabilizes movements like informants do).

This discussion, coming in October, will center [Why Misogynists Make Great Informants](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/courtney-desiree-morris-why-misogynists-make-great-informants), an article by Courtney Desiree Morris that analyzes the consequences of unchecked misogyny for our movements and how this unchecked misogyny benefits the state&mdash;Morris specifically details the story of a misogynist later revealed to be an informant.
